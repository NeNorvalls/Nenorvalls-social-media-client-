WORKFLOW CA

This project is made for students to acquire knowledge on proper testing. Both in unit testing and e2e-testing (End-to-end testing).
We are well provided with good modules to follow through and to understand the whole concepts and ideas for this. Very beneficial or useful for the future
of us students. With this project, we learned about testing in both ways, formulating our code syntax to be equipped well for the testing, how to fork 
a repo, and how to follow standard step-by-step processes. Learnings for cloning and initializing certain commits. trials and error, solving and 
understanding errors, and building up understanding through it. From setting ups all the initial setups until the end of the testing, updating,
and committing. Building confidence and accessing all peer reviews to gain more ideas are very useful for this project. Being introduced to and using
cypress, testing it via electron, jest, ESLint and etc is very overwhelming. Putting all the effort and heart into this project, sleepless nights and 
positive thinking makes it all worthwhile succeeding in a successful result.
